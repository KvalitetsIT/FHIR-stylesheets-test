This repo is a version of medcom's [FHIR-stylesheets](https://github.com/medcomdk/FHIR-stylesheets) repo that should be used for testing the [FhirKit](https://github.com/KvalitetsIT/FhirKit/tree/main) integration with github.

This repo includes directories, valid and invalid stylesheets.
[FhirKit](https://github.com/KvalitetsIT/FhirKit/tree/main) should warn if it finds directories and invalid file types.
